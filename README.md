# Atmospheric Science Research Project

This repository contains an independent research project conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Travis O'Brien, focusing on the study of precipitation drivers in the Tropics.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this research project is to investigate the key drivers of precipitation in the Tropics.

## Notebooks Overview

### First Notebook (Tropics_1.ipynb)

#### Objectives

In the initial notebook, the focus was on introducing and exploring two specific regions in the Tropics. The primary analysis aimed to understand the relationship between precipitation and Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). The specific objectives were as follows:

- Introduce and define the regions of interest in the Tropics.
- Create scatterplots to visually explore the relationship between precipitation and CAPE.
- Lay the foundation for subsequent analysis and insights.

#### Key Findings

The analysis in the first notebook yielded the following key findings:

- Identified the ideal CAPE range for precipitation, which falls between 250 and 1500 J/Kg.
- Noted a decrease in precipitation beyond 1500 J/Kg CAPE.

### Second Notebook (Tropics_2.ipynb)

#### Objectives

The goal of the second notebook was to examine how CAPE evolves during a top 5% precipitation period. The analysis involved producing a time series illustrating the evolution of CAPE and precipitation over an 18-day period, with day 9 representing the day of maximum precipitation.

#### Key Findings

Key findings from the second notebook include:

- Observation that the maximum CAPE occurs before the maximum precipitation, indicating a lead time in CAPE changes.
- Recognition that a significant portion of CAPE is utilized during the day of maximum precipitation, resulting in a noticeable dip in CAPE.
