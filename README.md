Independent research project under the mentorship of Dr.Travis O'Brien

Goal - Study the drivers of precipitation in the Tropics.

First Notebook

1) In the first notebook we introduced the two regions in the tropics I will be focusing on for this project.
2) Created plots for Precipitation vs CAPE to observe any direct relations.

Result - From the plots I found that ideal CAPE range for precipitation is between 500-1500 J/Kg. I decided to introduce CIN to the picture for the next few notebooks to study why there is a decrease in precipitation once the CAPE crosses 1500 J/Kg
