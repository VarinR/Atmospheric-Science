## Project Goal

The primary goal of this research project is to investigate the key drivers of precipitation in the Tropics.

## Notebooks Overview

### First Notebook (Tropics_1.ipynb)

#### Objectives

In the initial notebook, the focus was on introducing and exploring two specific regions in the Tropics. The primary analysis aimed to understand the relationship between precipitation and Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE). The specific objectives were as follows:

- Introduce and define the regions of interest in the Tropics.
- Create scatterplots to visually explore the relationship between precipitation and CAPE.
- Lay the foundation for subsequent analysis and insights.

#### Key Findings

- Identified the ideal CAPE range for precipitation, which falls between 250 and 1500 J/Kg.
- Noted a decrease in precipitation beyond 1500 J/Kg CAPE.

### Second Notebook (Tropics_2.ipynb)

#### Objectives

The goal of the second notebook was to examine how CAPE evolves during a top 5% precipitation period. The analysis involved producing a time series illustrating the evolution of CAPE and precipitation over an 18-day period, with day 9 representing the day of maximum precipitation.

#### Key Findings

- Observation that the maximum CAPE occurs before the maximum precipitation, indicating a lead time in CAPE changes.
- Recognition that a significant portion of CAPE is utilized during the day of maximum precipitation, resulting in a noticeable dip in CAPE.

### Third Notebook (Tropics_3_cin-land.ipynb)

#### Objectives

- Define seasons for the grid cell, identifying three significant periods: first monsoon (MAM), dry season (JJA), and second monsoon (SON).
- Create binned CAPE panel plots for precipitation and CIN to analyze the relationship between CAPE, CIN, and precipitation.

#### Key Findings

- Optimal precipitation conditions (exceeding 5 mm/day) with CAPE values of 1000 to 1750 J/kg.
- Identified threshold lower than actual regional rainfall due to reanalysis data and averaging.
- Elevated CIN suppresses precipitation, but positive CIN (80 to 140 J/kg) is crucial for triggering high-precipitation events.
- Positive CIN condition often aligns with CAPE values close to 1500 J/kg.

### Fourth Notebook (Tropics_3_cin-land.ipynb)

#### Objectives

- Investigate the influence of surface heating on precipitation patterns in the studied grid cell over the South China Sea.
- Explore the relationship between Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and Convective Inhibition (CIN) in the context of surface heating and monsoon variability.

#### Key Findings

- Optimal precipitation conditions (exceeding 5 mm/day) with CAPE values of 250 to 1000 J/kg for the second monsoon, while convection doesn't play a major role in the first monsoon
- Same as over land elevated CIN suppresses precipitation, but positive CIN (80 to 140 J/kg) is crucial for triggering high-precipitation events.
- The influence of surface heating on CAPE exhibits a notable discrepancy between oceanic and terrestrial regions. Unlike the ocean, where surface heating's impact on CAPE is less pronounced, terrestrial areas experience a more substantial influence, shaping the intensity and distribution of convective potential as seen in notebook 3.

# Conclusion

Semester 1 

1. **CAPE and Precipitation Relationship:**
   - Identified an optimal CAPE range (250 to 1500 J/Kg) for precipitation.
   - Noted a decrease in precipitation beyond 1500 J/Kg CAPE.

2. **CAPE Evolution during High Precipitation Period:**
   - Observed a lead time in CAPE changes, with maximum CAPE occurring before the day of maximum precipitation.
   - Significant utilization of CAPE during the day of maximum precipitation, resulting in a noticeable dip.

3. **Seasonal Variation and CAPE/CIN Dynamics:**
   - Found optimal precipitation conditions (exceeding 5 mm/day) with CAPE values of 1000 to 1750 J/kg during specific monsoon seasons.
   - Elevated CIN suppressed precipitation, but positive CIN (80 to 140 J/kg) was crucial for triggering high-precipitation events.

4. **Surface Heating Influence and CAPE/CIN Discrepancy:**
   - Surface heating played a pivotal role in precipitation patterns, with optimal conditions (exceeding 5 mm/day) observed for CAPE values of 250 to 1000 J/kg during the second monsoon season.
   - Similar to over land, elevated CIN suppressed precipitation, but positive CIN (80 to 140 J/kg) was crucial for triggering high-precipitation events.

The collective analysis underscores the intricate interplay between atmospheric instability, convective processes, and surface conditions.
